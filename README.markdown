This is the project page for the Beer && Code Seattle web site
=============================

**This is the [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) port of the Beer && Code site**

Beer && Code has grown and the community would like to see the site grow with it.

Our goals are still the same:

* The site should EXPLAIN what Beer && Code is
* The site should ORGANIZE by detailing when and where each event occurs
* The site should INSPIRE people to share and collaborate on projects
* The site should EXCITE people about the idea (ie, it should look cool)

Please see the Issues page for feature ideas

## Current Build Instructions
**Prerequisites:** 

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org)

**Dependency Installation:**

* See the package.json file. You should just be able to run `npm install` within the same directory as this file to get all the dependencies

**Running the site**

* `node app.js`
* Install [nodemon](http://search.npmjs.org/#/nodemon) from NPM to make changes without having to restart the server manually

**Stuff you can learn to contribute**

* [node](http://nodejs.org) - Good to read if you've never used node
* [express](http://expressjs.com/) - Microframework. Basic core of the site
* [jade](http://jade-lang.com) - Templating engine. Kind of like HAML
* [stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/) - Stylesheets. Kind of like less/sass
