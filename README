This is the project page for the Beer && Code Seattle web site

There are no decisions (technical or otherwise) other than the following:

* The site should EXPLAIN what Beer && Code is
* The site should ORGANIZE by detailing when and where each event occurs
* The site should INSPIRE people to share and collaborate on projects
* The site should EXCITE people about the idea (ie, it should look cool)

Another idea was to create a way to list 'regulars'
  This would be a good way for us to learn each other's names
  
Things that are still up in the air:
  What technology to use
  The look and feel of the site
  Other features I didn't list here
